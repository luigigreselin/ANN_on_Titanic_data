# Titanic: predicting from a disaster

Data science project on classification. Data on ~ 800 passengers were given divided in 11 variables (plus the survived column, which was the outcome. The objective was to predict whether the passenger would have survived or not

# My objective:
Get familiar with fully connected neural network in the keras library, by using dropout layers and early stopping.

# Data preprocessing / EDA
Refer to the analysis by [Ken Jee](https://www.kaggle.com/kenjee/titanic-project-example), that I have repeated in a different notebook

# Results
Unfortunately the size of the dataset was too small to apply a NN, as the results were always unpredictable, and often the loss function was higher for the training dataset than for the validation. However the main object of getting familiar with the Keras library was accomplished
